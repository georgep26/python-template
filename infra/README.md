# Infrastructure as Code

This directory contains Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates and configurations for deploying the Python template project.

⚠️ **Important**: These are example templates that should be customized and overwritten for new projects.

## Available IaC Options

### 1. Terraform

The Terraform configuration creates the following AWS resources:

- **S3 Bucket**: For storing application data
- **DynamoDB Table**: For application data storage

#### Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- AWS account with necessary permissions

#### Usage

Deploy using the centralized deployment script:

1. Deploy to development environment:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy/terraform.sh dev
   ```

2. Deploy to other environments:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy/terraform.sh staging
   ./scripts/deploy/terraform.sh prod
   ```

#### Available Actions

- `deploy` (default): Deploy the infrastructure
- `plan`: Show deployment plan
- `destroy`: Destroy the infrastructure
- `init`: Initialize Terraform
- `validate`: Validate Terraform configuration
- `output`: Show Terraform outputs

#### Variables

You can customize the deployment by setting variables:

```bash
terraform apply -var="environment=prod" -var="aws_region=us-west-2"
```

Available variables:
- `aws_region`: AWS region (default: us-east-1)
- `project_name`: Project name (default: python-template)
- `environment`: Environment name (default: dev)

### 2. CloudFormation

The CloudFormation template creates the following AWS resources:

- **S3 Bucket**: For storing application data with encryption and versioning
- **DynamoDB Table**: For application data storage with point-in-time recovery
- **IAM Role**: For application execution with appropriate permissions
- **CloudWatch Log Group**: For application logging

#### Prerequisites

- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed and configured
- AWS account with necessary permissions
- Appropriate IAM permissions for CloudFormation operations

#### Usage

Deploy using the centralized deployment script:

1. Deploy to development environment:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy/cloudformation.sh dev
   ```

2. Deploy to other environments:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy/cloudformation.sh staging
   ./scripts/deploy/cloudformation.sh prod
   ```

#### Available Actions

- `deploy` (default): Deploy or update the stack
- `update`: Update an existing stack
- `delete`: Delete the stack
- `validate`: Validate the template
- `status`: Show stack status and outputs

## Choosing Between Terraform and CloudFormation

### Use Terraform when:
- You need multi-cloud support
- You prefer declarative configuration with state management
- You want advanced features like modules and workspaces
- You need complex dependency management

### Use CloudFormation when:
- You're working exclusively with AWS
- You want native AWS integration
- You prefer YAML/JSON configuration
- You need tight integration with AWS services

## Customization for New Projects

Before using these templates for a new project:

1. **Review and modify** resource configurations based on your requirements
2. **Update naming conventions** to match your organization's standards
3. **Adjust IAM permissions** according to your security policies
4. **Add or remove resources** as needed for your specific use case
5. **Update parameters and variables** to match your project needs

## Getting Started

1. Choose your preferred IaC tool (Terraform or CloudFormation)
2. Use the centralized deployment scripts in `scripts/deploy/`
3. Follow the usage instructions in the respective README files
4. Customize the templates for your project requirements
5. Deploy to your AWS environment

## Deployment Scripts

All deployment scripts are centralized in the `scripts/deploy/` directory:

- `cloudformation.sh` - CloudFormation deployment script
- `terraform.sh` - Terraform deployment script
- `README.md` - Detailed usage instructions for both scripts

This provides a consistent interface for deploying infrastructure regardless of the chosen tool.
