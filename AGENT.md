# Instructions for Coding Agents

## ⚠️ Important: This is a Template Repository

This repository is a **template** for Python projects. It provides a standardized structure, configuration, and best practices that should be used as a foundation for building new applications.

## 📋 Prerequisites: Required Reading

**Before making any changes to this repository or using it as a base for a new project, you MUST:**

1. **Read `README.md` completely** - This file provides:
   - Project overview and purpose
   - Environment setup instructions
   - Directory structure explanation
   - Configuration details
   - Code quality tools information

2. **Read `docs/template-outline.md` completely** - This file provides:
   - Detailed repository structure
   - Configuration file specifications
   - CI/CD workflow definitions
   - GitHub project setup guidelines
   - Best practices and standards

**Do not proceed with any modifications until you have thoroughly read and understood both documents.**

## 🏗️ Working with the Template

### When Building Applications on Top of This Template

When designing and implementing applications using this template as a foundation:

1. **Preserve the Directory Structure**
   - Maintain the standard directory layout (`config/`, `src/`, `tests/`, `infra/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, `notebooks/`)
   - Follow the organizational patterns established in the template

2. **Replace Example Code with Real Application Logic**
   - The template contains **example/placeholder code** (e.g., `src/main.py`, `tests/test_main.py`)
   - **Swap out these examples** with actual application-specific code
   - Keep the same file structure and naming conventions, but implement real functionality

3. **Update Configuration Files**
   - Modify `config/app_config.yml` with actual application settings
   - Update `environment.yml` with project-specific dependencies
   - Adjust `pyproject.toml` with relevant project metadata and tool configurations

4. **Customize Documentation**
   - Update `README.md` to reflect the actual application purpose and features
   - Modify or extend documentation in `docs/` as needed
   - Update the directory structure diagram in `README.md` if you add new directories

5. **Maintain Template Standards**
   - Follow the coding standards and practices outlined in the template
   - Use the pre-commit hooks and code quality tools configured in the template
   - Adhere to the changelog format and versioning standards

## 🎯 Key Principles

- **Structure First**: Use the template's directory structure as your foundation
- **Replace Examples**: Don't just modify example code—replace it with real application logic
- **Maintain Standards**: Keep the configuration, testing, and documentation standards from the template
- **Read Before Acting**: Always read `README.md` and `docs/template-outline.md` before making changes

## 📝 Example Workflow

1. Read `README.md` and `docs/template-outline.md` completely
2. Understand the directory structure and configuration approach
3. Identify which template files are examples vs. configuration
4. Replace example code (`src/main.py`, `tests/test_main.py`) with actual application code
5. Update configuration files with real application settings
6. Customize documentation to reflect the actual application
7. Maintain the template's structure, standards, and best practices

---

**Remember**: This template is a starting point. Use its structure and standards, but implement real application functionality that serves the specific needs of your project.
